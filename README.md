# File-Crawler-v2
This lab was about file crawler or spider. An extension of lab 4.
The requirement was to make a file crawler using multi-threads that will return file names which resembles keyword or contains keyword.
Keyword is provided by the user. Only text files were required to check whether the keyword is present in them or not.
I had to make a map of string,string to map file names to their paths to easily provide paths of respective files.
